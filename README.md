# Kirigen - Flows
Framework to develop cognitive-ai solutions.

## 🌟 Overview

Flows aims to simplify AI workflow orchestration through strong typing and graph-based composition. Built on the foundation of `pydantic-ai` and `pydantic-graphs`, our goal is to provide a unified interface for connecting various AI services while maintaining strict type safety and validation at every step.

## 🎯 Vision

Create a framework where developers can:
- Build complex AI workflows with type safety guarantees
- Switch between different AI providers seamlessly
- Compose multi-modal AI operations with confidence
- Focus on business logic instead of integration challenges

## 🔄 Planned Workflow Domains

### Audio Processing
- Music analysis and generation flows
- Speech processing pipelines
- Multi-format audio handling

### Visual Processing
- Image analysis workflows
- Video processing pipelines
- Scene understanding graphs

### Language & Code
- Chat completion flows
- Code analysis pipelines
- Research automation graphs

Each domain will provide type-safe components that can be composed into complex workflows while maintaining strict type checking and validation.

## 🏗️ Technical Foundation
- Built on `pydantic-ai` for type-safe AI interactions
- Leverages `pydantic-graphs` for workflow composition
- Provider-agnostic design for flexibility
- Focus on validation and type safety

## 🆚 Design Philosophy

Unlike existing tools that focus primarily on LLM orchestration, Flows is being designed with these principles:

1. **Multi-Modal First**: Supporting audio, vision, and language workflows from day one
2. **Provider Agnostic**: Abstract provider-specific implementations behind consistent interfaces
3. **Type Safety**: Leverage Pydantic for comprehensive type checking and validation
4. **Graph-Based**: Built on `pydantic-graphs` for robust workflow composition
5. **Domain-Specific**: Specialized components for each AI domain

## 🛠️ Project Status
